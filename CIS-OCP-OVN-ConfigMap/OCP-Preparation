## OpenShift UDF Workshop - Cluster Preparation Guide

#### This document explains how to prepare the OpenShift cluster on UDF for first-time use and subsequent reboots. This includes ensuring all nodes are in the `Ready` state and verifying cluster availability.

### ðŸ”§ First Boot - Approving Node CSRs

Use this procedure **only on first boot**, or when the cluster fails to bring nodes into `Ready` state.

```bash
oc config use-context default/api-ocp-f5-udf-com:6443/recovery

while date; do
  oc get nodes
  oc get csr --no-headers | grep Pending | awk '{print $1}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
  sleep 5
done

### Keep running the loop above until all nodes show Ready in the output of:

oc get nodes
