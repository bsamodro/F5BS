## CIS - OpenShift Workshop - OCP Cluster Preparation Guide

#### This document explains how to prepare the OpenShift cluster on LAB for first-time use and subsequent reboots. This includes ensuring all nodes are in the `Ready` state and verifying cluster availability.

### Prepare Working Directory to run next steps


#### Use the Web Shell link of the ocp-provisioner node and Please keep this window open until the end of the lab

- Login as cloud-user
  ```
  su - cloud-user
  ```
- Clean previous firefox docker
  ```
  docker stop firefox
  docker rm firefox
  ```
- Create new firefox docker
  ```bash
  
  docker run -d \
  --name=firefox \
  -p 5800:5800 \
  -v ~/firefox-saas:/config:rw \
  --restart=always \
  --add-host arcadia.f5demo:10.1.10.101 \
  jlesage/firefox
  ```

Use the FIREFOX link of the ocp-provisioner node. With this you will be running a docker firefox remotely inside your browser, from there you can browse to the OpenShift UI URLs (or any other).

### First Boot or Node is not ready - Approving Node CSRs

In Webshell Terminal, Check if all node status are ready
```bash
oc get nodes
```

Output
```bash
NAME                      STATUS   ROLES                         AGE    VERSION
master-1.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
master-2.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
master-3.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
worker-1.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    worker                        688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
worker-2.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    worker                        688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
```

### If all node are ready , jump to next step : [BigIP Preparation](BigIP-Preparation.md)

----

Use this procedure **only on first boot**, or when the cluster fails to bring nodes into `Ready` state.

```bash
oc config use-context default/api-ocp-f5-udf-com:6443/recovery

while date; do
  oc get nodes
  oc get csr --no-headers | grep Pending | awk '{print $1}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
  sleep 5
done
```
Keep running the loop above until all nodes show Ready in the output of:

```bash
oc get nodes
```

All Node status are ready
```bash
NAME                      STATUS   ROLES                         AGE    VERSION
master-1.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
master-2.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
master-3.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
worker-1.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    worker                        688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
worker-2.ocp.f5-udf.com   Ready    worker                        688d   v1.29.8+f10c92d
```

Wait 5‚Äì10 minutes after starting the environment, then log in with:

```bash
oc login -u f5admin -p f5admin
```

Use the following to monitor OpenShift component status:
```bash
watch oc get co
```
All components should show Available=True, Progressing=False, and Degraded=False.

If you‚Äôre still unable to log in after 15‚Äì20 minutes, or get connection errors:
- Re-run the CSR approval loop from the first boot step.
- Make sure all nodes are in Ready state with oc get nodes.
- Ensure your context is set to the correct recovery context:

```bash
oc config use-context default/api-ocp-f5-udf-com:6443/recovery
```
